# D3 React Range Bar

A demo of a datavis component I made for a different project.

My goal was to make a reusable component using D3 and React. Iâ€™m sure there is a proper name for this type of data visualisation. Havenâ€™t been able to crack it though, so we're sticking with range bar ðŸ˜Ž

These bars work very well for weather data

You could also use it to point out your favourite section of a song you've been listening to recently

Put the bar wherever your heart desires. Small screens, large screen, screens that change sizes! The bar will fit!
